#### Google_Playstore_Analysis
In this project, we performed an extensive analysis of an app dataset using the Plotly library, a powerful tool for creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations. Our goal was to gain insights into the various features of the app, such as its size, price, and user reviews, and explore how these features impact the overall rating of the app.

To accomplish this, we first preprocessed the data to remove any missing values, duplicates, or irrelevant features. We then used Plotly to create a variety of visualizations, including scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps, to explore the relationships between different variables and identify any patterns or trends in the data.

Next, we trained a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest to predict the rating of the app based on its features. Random Forest is a powerful and flexible algorithm that can handle both categorical and numerical data, making it an ideal choice for this task. We used Python's scikit-learn library to implement the algorithm, and evaluated its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Finally, we created an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash, a web application framework that allows us to create custom, interactive dashboards using Python. The dashboard displayed key visualizations and insights from our analysis, including the distribution of app ratings, the impact of different features on the app rating, and the performance of the machine learning model.

Overall, our project demonstrated the power and flexibility of Plotly and scikit-learn for analyzing and predicting app ratings, and highlighted the importance of using interactive dashboards to communicate complex data insights to a broader audience.
